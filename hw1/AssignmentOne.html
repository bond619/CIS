<h1>HTML and some things you can do with it.</h1>

From wikipedia </h3>

In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee,
 a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, 
 a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. 
 In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.
 Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.
 That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. 
 In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.
 
 This is a small look into the past of how HTML was created.
